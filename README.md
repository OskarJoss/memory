## Code review

by Andreas Lindberg
- Some variables could be const instead of let since they are never reassigned. Example: line 186, 187 in functions.js
- In main.js you mostly use single quotes except on line 3, in functions you use double quotes in most cases, you could either change to do all single quotes or all double quotes to be more consistant.
- On lines 30 and 35 you could add ; at the end of the lines to make your code more consistant as well.
- When you complete the memory you get the number of moves you made, it would be nice to have number of moves showing before completing the game as well,
- Maybe add some media queries, to make the game more mobile friendly.
